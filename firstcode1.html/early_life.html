        <h1>EARLY LIFE</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in the province of Balamban, where I lived with my grandparents.
            I grew up in a small community surrounded by family, where life was simple but filled with love, meaningful traditions, and the joy of childhood games.
            I played almost every traditional Filipino game, from the thrilling rounds of patintero and the leaping excitement of luksong tinik to the competitive spirit of tumbang preso and piko.
            My afternoons were spent laughing, running, and strategizing with friends, making those memories a cherished part of my early years.
